                    <p>Description</p>
                    <p>Kingdom Hearts III is an upcoming action role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 4
                       and Xbox One. It is the twelfth installment in the Kingdom Hearts series, a sequel to Kingdom Hearts II, and the final chapter in the
                       Dark Seeker saga. Set after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, returning protagonist Sora is joined by Donald
                       Duck, Goofy, King Mickey and Riku in their search for the seven Guardians of Light and the "Key to Return Hearts" as they attempt
                       to thwart the restored Xehanort's plan to bring about a second Keyblade War. Their journey has them cross paths with characters
                       and visit worlds based on different Disney and Pixar properties.</p>

                    <p>Concepts for the game began as early as 2006 after the release of Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix in Japan, with the game not being
                       announced until 2013, following years of rumors and speculation. Kingdom Hearts III sees many returning gameplay features from
                       the series, while expanding parties to five characters total, introducing new "Attraction Flow" attacks that incorporate various Disney
                       Parks attractions, and mini-games inspired by classic Walt Disney Productions Mickey Mouse cartoons in the style of 1980s LCD
                       games. The game was built using Unreal Engine 4. It is scheduled to be released worldwide in January 2019.</p>
